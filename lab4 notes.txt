filter udp (and possibly icmp)

//payload = 29 bytes, Length = 37, total length of IPv4 = 57, IPv4 header = 20

//ipv4 load = 57-20 = 37 = Length
//Length - payload = 8 bytes = UDP header size

//if u click on User Datagram Protocol, it says the header is 8 bytes



1. 4 Fields: source, destination, length, checksum

2. 

payload = 29 bytes, Length = 37, total length of IPv4 = 57, IPv4 header = 20

ipv4 load = 57-20 = 37 = Length
Length - payload = 8 bytes = UDP header size

if u click on User Datagram Protocol, it says the header is 8 bytes

3. 

Value in length field = 37 = the IPv4 packet (total size minus the header)
ipv4 load = 57-20 = 37 = Length

4. 

5. 

6. UDP protocol number is 17 in decimal and 11 in hexadecimal

7. The port numbers in the two packets are the same
